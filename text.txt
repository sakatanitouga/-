To whom it may concern,
I found your web site on the Internet and would like to inquire about the price for single room.
I am planning to stay around the middle of September, so it would be nice if you could inform me whether rooms will be available during this time.
And do you accept credit cards?
You can either E-mail or Fax your information?
